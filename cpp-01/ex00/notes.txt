STACK VS HEAP
DETERMINAR EM QUAL CASO E MELHOR ALOCAR SUMBIS NA STACK OU NO HEAP

'new' KEYWORD IS AN operator that:

✅ 1. Allocates memory on the heap
✅ 2. Calls the constructor of the object
✅ 3. Returns a pointer to the newly created object

EVERY NEW MUST HAVE A CORRESPONDING 'delete;

Heap (new)
- Lives until you delete it
- You get a pointer
- Manual memory management

Stack
`` Zombie z("Bob"); ```
- Automatically freed when it goes out of scope
- No delete needed
- No pointer unless you take its address
