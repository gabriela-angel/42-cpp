TO SEARCH:
 - file types in cpp (.tpp, .hpp/.h, .cpp)
 - the standard library
 - NOT USE (but search): Boost libraries, *printf(), *alloc() and free()
 - NOT USE (but search): using namespace <ns_name> and friend keywords
 - STL (?)
	(?) You are allowed to use the STL only in Modules 08 and 09. That means:
		no Containers (vector/list/map, and so forth) and no Algorithms (anything that
		requires including the <algorithm> header) until then.
 - Allocating memory
 - Orthodox Canonical Form
 - function templates (?) -> same as func prototypes ?
 - include guards
